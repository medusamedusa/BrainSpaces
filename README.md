# BrainSpaces

This is the code prepared by Maria Mannone, with the help of ChatGPT for technical details (but with human debugging), to compute brain spaces once having received connectivity matrices as input. It complements the submission "Sketching a Space of Brain States" by Maria Mannone, Patrizia Ribino, Peppino Fazio, and Norbert Marwan.
